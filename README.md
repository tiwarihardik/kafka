# Basic Producer-Consumer Model in Python (`Progess-1`)

**Aim:**  To set up a simple messaging system where a producer can send messages to a broker, and a consumer can retrieve messages from the broker.
---
## How it Works
**Broker** acts as a simple in-memory queue that stores messages.
**Producer** sends messages to the broker.
**Consumer** retrieves messages from the broker.
---
## Running the Example
Start by running `producer.py` to publish messages.
Then, run `consumer.py` to consume the messages.
